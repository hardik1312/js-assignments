How does async/await help with performance and scalability?
*/

// Async await help us in achieving asynchronous javascript, which
// is similar to multi-threaded execution. Js by default, doesn't have multithreads.
// In asynchronous js, multiple asynchronous functions start executing at the same
// time and are returned when triggered, this helps achieving smooth user 
// experience and no delays.
