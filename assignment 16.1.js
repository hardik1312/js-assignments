/*
The time has a format: hours:minutes. Both hours and minutes
have two digits, like 09:00.
Make a regex to find time in the string: Lunch at 10:10 in the room
123:456. In this task thereâ€™s no need to check time correctness yet,
so 25:99 can also be a valid result. The regex should not match
333:333.
